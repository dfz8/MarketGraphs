# MarketGraphs
After a few externships at three financial companies in Beijing and Shanghai in the summer of 2014, I was interested by the graphing software they used.

So I made this little model, that graphs a stock/bond/anything with random increases/decreases. I added some neat features such as candlesticks and a zoom.
